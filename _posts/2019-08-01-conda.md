### Installation
Miniconda is lighter than Anaconda. That's why I've choosen to use Miniconda.
1. First, download the installation file from [Miniconda site](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for your OS and python version.
2. Install Miniconda
   ```
   $ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```
3. Run Miniconda
   ```
   $ source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Conda environment
You can create new environment of conda. You can also create it in python version you want.
1. Create new environment
    ```
    (base) $ conda create -n sample_env python=3.7
    ```
2. Activate the environment
   ```
   (base) $ conda activate sample_env
   ```
3. Install package you want to use
   ```
   (sample_env) $ conda install packagename
   ```
4. Deactivate the environment after you finish your work
   ```
   (sample_env) $ conda deactivate sample_env
   ```

### Export conda environment
You might want to use same conda environment in other machines.
1. Export your conda environment
   ```
   (sample_env) $ conda env export -f env.yml
   ```
2. Import your conda environment in other machines.
   ```
   (base) $ conda env create -f env.yml
   ```

### Conclusion
I hope your life to be happier than before using Miniconda.
